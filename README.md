# Matrix

An implementation of `Matrix` and `Vector` classes.

The `Matrix` class represents a mathematical matrix. It provides methods for creating matrices, operating on them arithmetically and algebraically, and determining their mathematical properties (trace, rank, inverse, determinant).

The `Vector` class represents a mathematical vector, which is useful in its own right, and also constitutes a row or column of a `Matrix`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'matrix'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install matrix
